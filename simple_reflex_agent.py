'''Lab 1 (Python): Reflex-based Intelligent Agent
Objective:
To design and implement reflex-based intelligent agents that make real-time decisions based on percepts from dynamic environments, such as traffic flow and presence detection.
To simulate environment-agent interaction using Python, demonstrating how agents can control systems like traffic signals and smart home lighting based on simple conditionâ€“action rules.'''
